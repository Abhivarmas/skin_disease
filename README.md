# skin_disease_classification
Developed an image classification model using 3 different CNN architectures, 
ResNet, MobileNet, & EfficientNetB0 on a skin disease dataset. A webpage is 
developed as an application of this project, using which a user can easily detect the 
type of disease by uploading an image. Libraries used in this project are Numpy, 
Pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, Keras, Tensorflow and flask is used for webpage
